# Pomodoro + Eisenhower Matrix GNOME Extension: Development Plan

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a GNOME extension that enhances productivity by combining the Pomodoro Technique with the Eisenhower Matrix. The extension will allow users to prioritize their tasks efficiently and maintain focus by using time-boxed work sessions.

## Key Components

1. **Task Management Interface**
   - A visual interface for the Eisenhower Matrix to allow users to add, edit, and categorize tasks.
   - Each task will have attributes such as title, description, and quadrant assignment.

2. **Pomodoro Timer Integration**
   - A timer functionality to implement the Pomodoro Technique.
   - Configurable work session and break durations (default to 25-minute work sessions and 5-minute breaks).
   - Notifications for the start and end of work sessions and breaks.

3. **Automatic Task Suggestion**
   - An algorithm to suggest the next task based on the user's priority quadrant.
   - Customizable preferences to allow users to adjust the suggestion logic (e.g., focus on "Urgent and Important" tasks first).

4. **Productivity Insights**
   - Track the number of Pomodoro sessions completed.
   - Provide statistics on completed tasks by quadrant.
   - Visual charts or graphs to show productivity trends.

## Development Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Setup

- [ ] Set up the project repository on GitHub.
- [ ] Create a basic GNOME extension framework using JavaScript.
- [ ] Develop the task management interface for the Eisenhower Matrix.

### Phase 2: Pomodoro Timer Development

- [ ] Implement the Pomodoro timer functionality.
- [ ] Integrate notifications for Pomodoro sessions and breaks.
- [ ] Allow customization of session lengths.

### Phase 3: Task Suggestion Algorithm

- [ ] Design and implement an algorithm to suggest tasks based on priority.
- [ ] Create user preferences for customizing the task suggestion logic.

### Phase 4: Productivity Insights

- [ ] Develop a tracking system to log completed Pomodoros and tasks.
- [ ] Build a dashboard to display productivity insights using charts or graphs.

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement

- [ ] Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the interface and functionality.
- [ ] Refine features based on user feedback.
- [ ] Fix bugs and optimize performance.

### Phase 6: Release and Documentation

- [ ] Prepare the extension for release on GNOME Extensions.
- [ ] Write comprehensive user documentation and provide installation instructions.
- [ ] Create a promotional plan to share the extension with potential users.

## Future Enhancements

- **Synchronization Across Devices:** Enable cloud synchronization to manage tasks and Pomodoro sessions across multiple devices.
- **Integration with To-Do Apps:** Integrate with popular task management apps (e.g., Todoist, Trello).
- **Customizable Themes:** Allow users to customize the extension's appearance with different themes.

## Conclusion

By integrating the Pomodoro Technique with the Eisenhower Matrix, this GNOME extension aims to provide a powerful tool for improving productivity, focus, and task management. The extension will be easy to use, visually appealing, and highly customizable to cater to different user needs.
